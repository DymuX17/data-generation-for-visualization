# Engineering Project for Process Data Acquisition, Analysis, and Visualization

This project was created to implement an system that acquires, analyzes, and visualizes process data from two simultaneously simulated industrial processes.

---

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Data Generation for Visualization**
The first of the three projects, **data-generation-for-visualisation**, is responsible for downloading the data through communication interfaces (OPC_UA, S7comm) and timing them. The synchronized data is then sent to the Kafka platform, through which it passes and is ultimately stored in the **InfluxDB** database.

---

## Features
- **Real-time Data Acquisition**: Communication interfaces to download real-time process data.
- **Data Synchronization**: Ensures data is synchronized before sending it to the Apache Kafka platform.
- **Data Storage**: Uses Kafka for data streaming and InfluxDB for data storage.

---

## System Context  
Data originates from Siemens S7-1500 PLCs simulated in **TIA Portal** and **PLC-SIM Advanced**, operating in parallel via two communication protocols:  
- **S7comm**  
- **OPC UA**  

InfluxDB is deployed as a **Docker container** to store both raw error data and the results of the analysis.

## Usage  

1. **Start InfluxDB (Docker)**  
   Make sure the InfluxDB container is running and reachable.

2. **Set Environment Variables**  
   Create a `.env` file with the required variables:
   ```env
   INFLUXDB_URL=http://localhost:8086
   INFLUXDB_TOKEN=your_token
   INFLUXDB_ORG=your_org
   INFLUXDB_BUCKET=your_bucket
   
3. **Start Kafka Container**
Run Kafka in KRaft mode using the provided docker-compose.yml:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. **Run Analysis Script**
Launch the main analysis process:

```bash
python main.py
```
